# Chess Engine Skeleton

This repository contains a minimal Rust‑based chess engine skeleton. The goal is to provide a clean starting point for building a full chess engine with move generation, validation and basic UI.

## Project Structure

+src/
├── lib.rs          # Public API re‑exports
├── game/           # Core chess logic
│   ├── board.rs    # Board representation and initialization
│   └── piece.rs    # Piece types and movement rules
└── ui/            # Console rendering helpers (stub)

tests/
    └── ...          # Unit tests for board and move logic

Cargo.toml           # Pure Rust, no external dependencies
+
## Building & Testing

+$ cargo build          # Compile the library
$ cargo test           # Run unit tests (currently empty)
+
## Usage Example

+use chess_app::{Board, Piece};

fn main() {
    let board = Board::new();
    // TODO: Add rendering or move logic
}
