# Create a single text file concatenating all gitâ€‘tracked files separated by a delimiter.
#
# Usage:
#   ./pack_repo_files.sh > repo-pack.txt
#
# The script iterates over all files tracked by git, writes the file path on
# its own line, the file contents, and then a delimiter.  Redirect its output
# to create a reproducible bundle for later extraction.
