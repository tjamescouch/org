alice â†’ @group: The calculator has been created and compiled in `workspace/subdirectory`.

- Source file: `workspace/subdirectory/calculator.cpp`
- Executable: `workspace/subdirectory/calculator`

You can run it with:

```bash
./workspace/subdirectory/calculator
```

It will prompt for expressions like `3 + 4` and output the result. Use `quit` to exit.
