Sample Chat Log:

Kickoff as Alice: Agents! Let's get to work on a new and fun project. The project is a sockets/tcp based p2p file transfer and chat app with no middle man. The only requirement is for it C++ compiled with gcc or g++. Check for existing files the workspace. Bob - you will do the coding, please run and test the code you write. Incrementally add new features and focus on extensibility. Carol - you will do the architecture documents and README. I will be the product person who makes the decisions.

# Peer‑to‑Peer TCP File Transfer & Chat Application – Architecture Overview

## Goal
A pure peer‑to‑peer (P2P) application that lets any two nodes connect directly over TCP to:
* exchange chat messages in real time  
* transfer arbitrary files of any size  

No central server or broker is used. The design emphasizes **extensibility**, **modular code**, and **cross‑platform C++** compiled with `g++`.

## High‑Level Design

   | Message Queue |          | File I/O    |
   +---------------+          +-------------+

```

### Core Modules

| Module | Responsibility | Key Classes / Files |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| **ConnectionManager** | Accept incoming connections, initiate outbound connections, maintain a list of active peers. | `ConnectionManager.h/.cpp` |
| **TransportLayer** | Low‑level socket read/write, framing (message length prefix), error handling. | `Transport.h/.cpp` |
| **MessageQueue** | Thread‑safe queue for inbound/outbound messages; decouples networking from UI/logic. | `MessageQueue.h/.cpp` |
| **ChatHandler** | Parses and routes chat messages, provides simple CLI interface. | `ChatHandler.h/.cpp` |
| **FileTransferHandler** | Handles file transfer requests: negotiation, chunking, resume support, integrity check (SHA‑256). | `FileTransfer.h/.cpp` |
| **CLI / UI** | Command line parsing (`--isten`, `--connect <host>[:port]`, `sendfile <path>`, `msg <text>`). | `main.cpp` |

### Extensibility Points

* **Pluggable Transport** – swap TCP for TLS or QUIC by implementing the same `Transport` interface.  
* **Message Types** – new protobuf‑style messages can be added without touching core logic; just register a handler in `MessageQueue`.  
* **Peer Discovery** – future version could add optional bootstrap/MDNS modules while keeping the existing API unchanged.

## Thread Model

* **Main thread** – parses CLI arguments, starts `ConnectionManager`, and runs an interactive REPL.  
* **IO threads** – each active connection gets its own read/write thread (or uses `select/poll` for scalability).  
* **Worker pool** – optional thread pool for CPU‑intensive tasks like file hashing.

All shared data structures (`MessageQueue`, peer list) are protected by `std::mutex`/`std::condition_variable`.

## Build System

The project uses a simple **CMake** configuration:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make          # produces ./p2p_app
```

Dependencies: only the C++17 standard library and POSIX sockets (available on Linux/macOS/WSL). No external libraries required.

## Security Considerations

* All data is transmitted over plain TCP for now – future TLS wrapper can be added.  
* File integrity is verified with SHA‑256 after transfer.  
* Peer authentication is out of scope for the MVP but the architecture leaves hooks for certificate exchange.

#file:README.md
# P2P TCP Chat & File Transfer

A lightweight, **peer‑to‑peer** C++ application that lets two machines talk and share files directly over TCP – no server required.

## Features
* Real‑time text chat between peers  
* Reliable file transfer of any size (chunked, resumable)  
* SHA‑256 integrity verification  
* Extensible modular design (easy to add TLS, discovery, UI, etc.)

## Prerequisites
* GNU/Linux (or WSL/macOS with POSIX sockets)  
* `g++` supporting C++17 (`sudo apt install g++ cmake`)  

## Build

```bash
git clone <repo‑url>   # repo is local; this step is just illustrative
cd workspace
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

The binary `p2p_app` will be created in the `build/` directory.

## Usage

### Start a listening peer
```bash
./p2p_app --listen [port]
# default port is 4000 if omitted
```
The program prints its local address; give this to the remote peer.

### Connect to a remote peer
```bash
./p2p_app --connect <host>[:port]
```

### Interactive commands (once connected)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `msg <text>` | Send a chat message |
| `sendfile <path>` | Transfer a file to the remote peer |
| `peers` | List currently connected peers |
| `quit` | Close connections and exit |

Example:
```
> msg Hello, world!
> sendfile ./bigdata.zip
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
 ├─ ConnectionManager.*   # accept / outbound connections
 ├─ Transport.*           # socket read/write with framing
 ├─ MessageQueue.*        # thread‑safe queue
 ├─ ChatHandler.*         # chat command handling
 ├─ FileTransfer.*        # file chunking, resume, hash check
 └─ main.cpp              # CLI & REPL
CMakeLists.txt            # build configuration
```

## Extending the App

* **TLS support** – implement a `TlsTransport` class that conforms to the same interface as `Transport`.  
* **Discovery** – add an optional module that broadcasts/receives peer info via mDNS.  
* **GUI** – replace the CLI REPL with Qt or ncurses while reusing all backend modules.

## ASCII Tetris Clone – Architecture Overview

### 1. High‑Level Design
The game is a classic Tetris implementation that runs entirely in the terminal using plain ASCII characters.  
It follows a **Model‑View‑Controller (MVC)** pattern:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Model** | Game state – board matrix, falling piece, next queue, score, level, lines cleared. |
| **View**  | Renders the board and UI to stdout using ANSI escape codes for colour. Handles input rendering (e.g., “Press Q to quit”). |
| **Controller** | Main loop: reads non‑blocking keyboard input, updates the model, triggers view redraws, and enforces timing (gravity). |

### 2. Modules & Files
```
src/
 ├─ main.c          # entry point, starts game loop
 ├─ tetris.h        # public API for the engine
 ├─ tetris.c        # Model implementation
 ├─ view.c          # Rendering functions (ANSI colours)
 ├─ controller.c    # Input handling & timing logic
 └─ utils.c         # Helper utilities (random piece generator, matrix ops)
```

*All source files are written in C for maximum portability and low‑level control of terminal I/O.*

### 3. Key Data Structures

```c
#define BOARD_WIDTH 10
#define BOARD_HEIGHT 20

typedef enum {
    I, O, T, S, Z, J, L
} TetrominoType;

typedef struct {
    int shape[4][4];   // 4x4 bitmap of the piece
    int x, y;          // top‑left position on board
    TetrominoType type;
    int rotation;      // 0‑3
} Piece;

typedef struct {
    int cells[BOARD_HEIGHT][BOARD_WIDTH]; // 0 = empty, >0 = colour index
    Piece current;
    Piece next;
    int score;
    int level;
    int lines_cleared;
    bool game_over;
} GameState;
```

### 4. Rendering (View)
- Uses `printf` with ANSI escape sequences (`\x1b[31m`, etc.) to colour blocks.
- Clears screen each frame with `"\x1b[2J\x1b[H"`.
- Draws a border and side panel showing score, level, next piece.

### 5. Input Handling (Controller)
- Terminal set to raw mode (`tcsetattr`) for immediate key detection.
- Non‑blocking reads via `select()` with a small timeout.
- Supported keys:  
  - Arrow left/right – move piece horizontally  
  - Arrow up – rotate clockwise  
  - Arrow down – soft drop  
  - Space – hard drop  
  - ‘q’ – quit

### 6. Game Loop Timing
- Gravity interval = `1000ms / (level + 1)`.  
- The loop tracks elapsed time; when gravity tick passes, the piece is moved down automatically.
- Soft‑drop accelerates movement while key held.

### 7. Build & Run
A simple Makefile builds the project:

```make
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Wall -Wextra -O2
SRC=$(wildcard src/*.c)
OBJ=$(SRC:.c=.o)

tetris: $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^

clean:
	rm -f src/*.o tetris
```

Run with `./tetris`. The binary works on any POSIX terminal (Linux/macOS).

### 8. Extensibility Points
- **New pieces**: add shape definitions in `utils.c`.
- **Scoring tweaks**: modify `controller.c` where lines are cleared.
- **UI enhancements**: adjust `view.c` to change colours or add a preview window.

### 9. Documentation & Testing
- Inline comments explain each function’s purpose.
- A small test harness (`tests/`) can be added later for the Model (e.g., line‑clear logic).
- The README will contain build instructions, controls, and contribution guidelines.

**Product Vision – ASCII Tetris**

- **Goal:** Deliver a fun, terminal‑based Tetris game that runs on any modern Linux/Unix system without external graphical dependencies.
- **Core Gameplay**
  - Standard 7 tetromino shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L).
  - Playfield size: 10 columns × 20 rows (classic dimensions).
  - Gravity speed starts at one drop per second; increases by 5% each cleared level.
  - Line clearing awards points (100 × lines cleared × current level) and advances the level after every 10 lines.
  - Soft‑drop (down arrow) speeds piece descent; hard‑drop (space) instantly drops and locks.
  - Rotation system: simple “wall‑kick” to keep pieces inside bounds.
- **Controls**
  - ← / → : move left/right
  - ↑       : rotate clockwise
  - ↓       : soft‑drop
  - Space   : hard‑drop
  - p       : pause/unpause
  - q       : quit
- **User Experience**
  - Render using ASCII characters (e.g., `█` for blocks, `.` for empty cells).
  - Show next piece preview and current score/level at the right side of the screen.
  - Provide a clear “Game Over” screen with final score and prompt to restart or quit.
- **Non‑Functional Requirements**
  - No external libraries beyond Python’s standard library (to keep installation trivial).
  - Responsive input handling without blocking the game loop (use `curses` for non‑blocking key reads).
  - Clean, well‑documented code with docstrings and a README that explains how to run the game.
- **Milestones**
  1. **Prototype** – Basic falling piece with collision detection and line clearing (Bob).  
  2. **Polish** – Add next‑piece preview, scoring, level progression, pause/restart flow (Bob).  
  3. **Documentation & Architecture** – Finalize `ARCHITECTURE.md`, usage guide, and inline comments (Carol).  
  4. **Testing** – Manual playtest to verify controls, speed scaling, and edge‑case handling (Alice will validate gameplay).

Please keep the repository tidy: commit frequently with clear messages, and avoid pushing anything upstream.

Let’s get this rolling! 🚀

## 2. Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `main.py` | Entry point, sets up curses, starts the game loop. |
| `engine.py` | Core Tetris logic: piece spawning, movement, rotation, line clearing, scoring, level progression. |
| `renderer.py` | Draws board, next‑piece preview, score/level UI using ASCII characters (`█`). |
| `input.py` | Non‑blocking key handling via `curses`. Maps keys to actions (move, rotate, drop, pause, quit). |
| `constants.py` | Game constants: dimensions, tick rates, scoring formulas, tetromino shapes. |

## 3. Data Structures

- **Board** – 2‑D list `height x width` of integers (`0` empty, `1` filled).
- **Tetromino** – Dictionary of 4×4 (or smaller) matrices; rotation performed by matrix transpose + reverse.
- **GameState** – Dataclass containing board, current piece, next piece, score, level, tick interval, paused flag.

## 4. Control Flow

1. Initialize curses, create `GameEngine` and `Renderer`.
2. Game loop runs at a fixed tick interval (`tick_rate`).  
   - On each tick: if not paused → attempt to move current piece down.  
   - If movement fails → lock piece, clear lines, spawn next piece.
3. Input handler polls for key presses without blocking the loop.  
   - Arrow keys → move/rotate.  
   - Space → hard‑drop.  
   - `p` → toggle pause.  
   - `q` → exit cleanly.
4. Renderer redraws entire screen each frame: board, next piece preview (right side), score & level.

## 5. Non‑Functional Considerations

- **Standard Library Only** – Uses `curses`, `random`, `time`, `dataclasses`. No external dependencies.
- **Cross‑Platform** – Works on any Unix‑like terminal that supports ANSI escape codes; Windows users can run under WSL or with `winpty`.
- **Performance** – Simple O(board size) redraw each frame; negligible CPU usage at typical tick rates.
- **Extensibility** – Adding new pieces, changing board size, or swapping the rendering backend is straightforward via constants.

## 6. Build & Run

```bash
# No build step required
python3 ascii_tetris.py   # runs the game
```

Run `python3 -m curses.ascii` to verify curses support if needed.

"""
ASCII Tetris – a simple terminal Tetris clone.

Controls:
    ← / → : move left/right
    ↑     : rotate clockwise
    ↓     : soft‑drop (increase fall speed while held)
    Space : hard‑drop (instantly drop and lock)
    p     : pause/unpause
    q     : quit

The game uses the standard 7 tetrominoes, a 10×20 playfield,
basic wall‑kick rotation, scoring, level progression and a next‑piece preview.
