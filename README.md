# Project Overview

Welcome to the project repository. This repository contains a simple project scaffold with a `Makefile` and source files. The goal is to provide a clean build environment using standard tools like `gcc` and `bun`.

## Directory Structure

```
/                # Root of the repository
├─ src/          # Source code
├─ include/      # Header files (if applicable)
├─ tests/        # Test suites
├─ Makefile      # Build instructions
└─ README.md     # This file
```

## Building the Project (C/C++)

To compile the C/C++ sources, run:

```sh
make
```

The `Makefile` handles compilation flags and dependencies.

## Build & Run (C/C++)

```bash
# Build the project
make

# Run the executable (replace <executable> with the actual name)
./<executable>
```

## Running JavaScript/TypeScript

If the project includes JavaScript or TypeScript files, you can use `bun`:

```sh
bun run <script>
```

## Testing

If tests are provided, they can be run with:

```bash
make test
```
