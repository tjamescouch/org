# Project Overview

Welcome to the project repository. This scaffold provides a clean build environment using standard tools like `gcc` for C/C++ sources and `bun` for JavaScript/TypeScript scripts. The repository includes a `Makefile`, source directories, and helpful documentation to get you started quickly.

├─ include/      # Header files (if applicable)

## Installation

If your project includes JavaScript/TypeScript components, ensure `bun` is installed:

```bash
# Install bun (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

For C/C++ development, make sure you have a compiler like `gcc` or `clang` installed:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu example
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## Build & Run (C/C++)

The `Makefile` handles compilation flags and dependencies. To compile the C/C++ sources:

```bash
# Build the project
make

# Run the resulting executable (replace <executable> with the actual name)
./<executable>
```

## Running JavaScript/TypeScript (bun)

If the project includes JavaScript or TypeScript files, you can execute them with `bun`:

```bash
# Run a script using bun
bun run <script>
```

Replace `<script>` with the path to your entry file (e.g., `src/index.ts`).

## Testing

If tests are provided, they can be run with:

```bash
make test
```
