# Project Overview

This repository provides a simple scaffold for building C/C++ projects with a `Makefile` and optionally running JavaScript/TypeScript scripts using **bun**. It includes example source files, a basic build system, and documentation to help you get started quickly.

├─ src/          # Source code (C/C++ files)
├─ include/      # Header files (if applicable)

## Build & Run

The project uses a `Makefile` for compilation. Ensure you have `gcc` (or a compatible compiler) installed.

```sh
# Build the project
make

# Run the resulting executable (replace <executable> with the actual name)
./<executable>
```

## JavaScript/TypeScript Support

If the repository contains JavaScript or TypeScript files, you can execute them with **bun**:

```sh
# Run a script using bun
bun run <script>
```

## Testing

If test suites are provided, run them with:

```sh
make test
```
