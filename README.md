_Agentic dev helpers that can ‚Äúdo things‚Äù in your repo while you watch, review,
and approve every change._

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Conversational**: give a task, the agent plans and executes.
- ü§ù Collaborative: works as part of a multi-agent setup, coordinating steps and maintaining a conversation between the agents.
- üß∞ **Tools**: `sh`, `apply_patch`, etc. 100% auditable.
- üîí **Safe-by-default**: denylist for dangerous paths; *every* change turns into
  a patch you review before it lands.
- üß™ **Deterministic runs**: all stdout/stderr, artifacts, and a git patch are
  saved under `.org/runs/<id>` for inspection or CI upload.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Optional containerized sandbox**: run steps inside a Podman container
  with no network by default.

> This is a developer productivity tool, not a security boundary. See
> [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for hardening guidance.

## Vision

Developers and operators deserve AI teammates they can **trust, understand, and control**.
Most tools either go fully automated (opaque, risky) or stay passive (just suggest, never act). This project takes a different stance:

* **Dev + DevOps, one CLI**: A single agentic workflow that works for both coding and operations. Write code, run infra, and patch your repo ‚Äî all inside the same safe loop.
* **Multi-agent as a first-class feature**: Collaboration isn‚Äôt a bolt-on. Agents can coordinate, debate, and hand off tasks, while you oversee and approve every change.
* **Sandbox + patch review**: Every command runs in isolation. Every file change is surfaced as a patch. Nothing merges until you say so.
* **Safety as a value, not a feature**: Guardrails, glob-based policies, and human-in-the-loop review make it impossible for an agent to ‚Äúgo rogue‚Äù in your repo.
* **Composable workflows**: Use it solo as a powerful dev helper, or spin up multiple agents to cover testing, ops, and review simultaneously.

The vision is simple: **an agent CLI that feels like a real teammate ‚Äî fast, opinionated, and safe.**

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) From a working repo with a clean git tree:
git status

# 2) Start an agent (uses your local LLM by default)
org --agents "alice:lmstudio" --max-tools 20

# 3) Ask for something small
@alice write ‚Äúhello world‚Äù to a file named hello/hello-world.txt
````

When the tool wants to touch the filesystem, it first produces a **patch**. You
can read, approve, or reject it. After approval, the agent continues.&#x20;

All artifacts for each run land in:

```
<your-repo>/.org/runs/<uuid>/
  ‚îú‚îÄ manifest.json
  ‚îú‚îÄ session.patch
  ‚îú‚îÄ steps/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ step-0.out / step-0.err / step-0.meta.json
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ step-1.out / ‚Ä¶
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ ‚Ä¶
  ‚îî‚îÄ artifacts/        # files added by the run (copied out of the sandbox)
```

`session.patch` is produced from a baseline commit created at run start, so it
contains exactly what changed during this run.&#x20;

---

## Installation

This project uses **Bun**.

```bash
bun install
bun run build    # if you have a build step
```

Optionally ensure Podman is installed if you plan to use the sandbox backend.

---

## CLI

```bash
org [options] [--prompt "‚Ä¶"]
```

You can run tools in a disposable **rootless Podman** container. This improves
repeatability and reduces accidental host modifications, while keeping everything
auditable.&#x20;

Enable:

```bash
export SANDBOX_BACKEND=podman
```

**Runtime layout (inside the container)**

```
/project  -> your repo (read-only)
/work     -> a scratch working copy (read-write)
```

We initialize a baseline commit inside `/work`, and compute the patch against
that baseline. Then we copy the patch and any **newly added** files back to
`<repo>/.org/runs/<id>/`.&#x20;

**Base image**

By default we look for `localhost/org-build:debian-12`. You can tag or load an
image that contains `bash`, `git`, `rsync`, and a few coreutils:

```bash
podman pull docker.io/library/debian:12
podman tag  docker.io/library/debian:12  localhost/org-build:debian-12
```

> The repo is bind-mounted; you do not need build toolchains baked into the image
> for most tasks.

---

## Write policy (what files the agent may touch)

Effective defaults:

```ts
allow: ['*', '**/*'],                 // top-level + nested files/dirs
deny:  ['.git/**', '.org/**', '.env', '**/*.pem', '.github/**']
```

Key semantics:

* `*` matches **top-level** names; `**/*` matches **nested** paths but **not**
  top-level. That‚Äôs why both appear in `allow`.
* Deny patterns **override** allows.
* The sandbox stages changes while **excluding** `.org/` and `.git/` so the
  patch only contains project edits.

You can override policy when creating a session if needed, but the defaults are
safe for most workflows.

---

## Streaming output & heartbeat

The `sh` tool streams `stdout`/`stderr` **live** to your terminal. During idle
periods, a small **heartbeat** prints a single `.` to `stderr` about once per
second so you know a long-running step is alive. These dots are **suppressed**
whenever an interactive UI is visible (the patch preview pager or the ‚ÄúApply
this patch?‚Äù prompt), to keep the review screen clean.&#x20;

---

## Patches, commits, and diffs

* Each run starts by creating a **baseline commit** in the sandbox working copy.

* After tools complete, we stage changes (skip `.org/`, `.git/`; force-add
  ignored-but-allowed files) and generate a patch:

  ```bash
  git -C /work -c diff.noprefix=false diff --binary <baseline>..HEAD > /work/.org/session.patch
  ```

* On approval, the patch is applied to your repo.

This approach ensures root-level files (e.g. `README.md`) and nested files
produce consistent diffs, and makes it obvious what changed in each run.


---

## Artifacts

Files **added** during the run are copied from the sandbox to:

```
.org/runs/<id>/artifacts/<path>
```

This is handy for compiler outputs, generated docs, or any ‚Äúoutside the repo‚Äù
products you want to keep with the run.&#x20;

---

## How it works (high level)

1. **Project root detection** ‚Äî run inside the current directory, or pass `-C` /
   `--project <dir>`.
2. **Session & policy** ‚Äî construct write policy (allow/deny), limits, and pick
   backend (`podman` or `none`).
3. **Sandbox prep** (podman) ‚Äî mount `/project:ro`, copy to `/work:rw`,
   initialize a baseline commit.
4. **Tool loop** ‚Äî the agent calls tools (primarily `sh`), producing step
   artifacts `steps/step-N.{out,err,meta.json}`.
5. **Policy enforcement** ‚Äî we commit each step, compute changed paths, **revert
   the step commit** if any changed file violates policy, and record
   `step-N.violation.txt`.
6. **Finalize & review** ‚Äî build `session.patch` (`baseline..HEAD`), open a
   pager for review, prompt to apply (or auto-apply if `--review auto` and
   patch is small, clean, and touches no restricted paths).

---

## Running from any directory

You don‚Äôt have to `cd` into the repo to use `org`. Two equivalent ways:

```bash
org -C /path/to/repo --agents "alice:lmstudio" --max-tools 50
# or
ORG_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/repo org --agents "alice:lmstudio"
```

When running **inside** a repo, just call `org` normally.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **‚ÄúNo patch produced‚Äù**

  * The command didn‚Äôt change tracked files (e.g., listing or printing only).
  * The write policy denied the path ‚Üí see `.org/runs/<id>/steps/step-N.violation.txt`.
  * The change was staged under `.org/` or `.git/` (ignored from patches).

* **Root-level files don‚Äôt show up**

  * Ensure policy includes both `'*'` (top-level) **and** `'**/*'` (nested).
  * If the file is ignored by `.gitignore`, we still force-add it when allowed.

* **Patch viewer ‚Äúwhat do I press?‚Äù**

  * It‚Äôs a pager (`delta` or `less`). **q** to quit, then you‚Äôll see:
    `Apply this patch? [y/N]`. Press **y** (Enter) to apply.

* **‚ÄúTrying to pull localhost/org-build\:debian-12‚Äù**

  * Build or tag the base image locally:
    `podman tag debian:12 localhost/org-build:debian-12`.

* **Heartbeat dots over the patch screen**

  * By design they‚Äôre suppressed during review; if you still see them, make sure
    you‚Äôre on the current build with heartbeat suppression enabled.

---

### Keyboard shortcuts

* **`i`** ‚Äî Interject. Opens a one-line prompt (`You:`) with line editing; after submit, the run resumes.
* **`Esc`** ‚Äî **Graceful shutdown.** Finalizes the sandbox (if active), saves `session.patch` and artifacts, then exits.
* **`Ctrl+C`** ‚Äî Immediate abort (best-effort cleanup only). Prefer **Esc** when you want patches/artifacts preserved.

---

### Quick run inspection (handy `jq` one-liners)

```bash
# Last run directory
RUN="$(ls -d .org/runs/* 2>/dev/null | sort | tail -1)"

# See the effective write policy that was used
jq -s '.[-1].spec.write' .org/runs/*/manifest.json

# Or just the last run‚Äôs policy:
jq '.spec.write' "$RUN/manifest.json"

# Show any policy violations (one file per step if blocked)
ls "$RUN"/steps/*violation.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "no violations"

# Pretty-view the patch (falls back to less if delta isn't available)
(delta "$RUN/session.patch" 2>/dev/null) || less -R "$RUN/session.patch"

# What changed between baseline and final?
jq -r '.steps[-1].exitCode as $ec | "last step exit=\($ec)"' "$RUN/manifest.json"
```

---

### Patch headers & root-level files (why you‚Äôll see `a/‚Ä¶` and `b/‚Ä¶`)

`org` generates diffs with Git‚Äôs default *prefixed* headers so top-level files (e.g., `README.md`) are handled the same as nested paths. If you‚Äôre debugging outside the sandbox, mirror the exact flags we use:

```bash
git -c diff.noprefix=false diff --binary <BASE>..HEAD
```

This yields headers like:

```
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
```

and ensures the patch viewer behaves the same for root and nested edits.

---

### Pager & heartbeat

* The patch viewer is a pager (`delta` if present, otherwise `less`). Press **`q`** to exit, then approve or reject.
* The **heartbeat dot** (period printed to `stderr` while a long command runs) is automatically **suppressed** whenever the patch UI or confirmation prompt is visible, so your review screen stays clean.

---

### Environment cheat-sheet (extras)

| Variable          | Typical values           | Purpose                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `ORG_PAGER`       | `delta`, `less`, `cat`   | Force a specific pager for `session.patch`.           |
| `ORG_REVIEW`      | `ask`, `auto`, `never`   | Patch review mode (defaults to interactive on a TTY). |
| `ORG_PROJECT_DIR` | `/path/to/repo`          | Operate on a repo without `cd` (alternate to `-C`).   |
| `SANDBOX_BACKEND` | `podman`, `none`, `auto` | Choose/disable the sandbox backend.                   |
| `SAFE_MODE`       | `1`/`true`               | Extra confirmation gates for shell & writes.          |

---

### Troubleshooting quick hits

* **‚ÄúNo patch produced‚Äù**
  The command didn‚Äôt change tracked files, the write policy blocked the path (check `steps/*violation.txt`), or the change lives under `.org/`/`.git/` which are intentionally excluded.

* **Root-level file didn‚Äôt appear**
  Ensure your allow list includes **both** `'*'` (top-level) **and** `'**/*'` (nested). This is the default policy; verify with the `jq` snippet above.

* **Heartbeat dots over the patch view**
  Update to the current build ‚Äî dots are suppressed while the review UI is active.

---

### Multi-agent workflows (optional)

* üß© **Works in multi-agent setups:** run several named agents (e.g., `"alice:lmstudio,bob:lmstudio"`). Agents can hand off tasks and you can interject at any time with **`i`** to steer the plan, while the same review-before-apply loop protects your repo.


---

## Tests

We include tests that exercise:

* **Glob & policy** ‚Äî `matchAny` semantics; deny-over-allow; top-level vs nested.
* **Patch generation** ‚Äî root & nested files produce headers with `a/` & `b/`
  prefixes (`-c diff.noprefix=false`).
* **Streaming/heartbeat** ‚Äî baseline behavior + suppression while UI is up.

Run:

```bash
bun test
```
