# Project Overview

Welcome to the project repository. This README provides an overview of the project, its structure, and how to get started.

## Project Title

**Simple C/C++ Scaffold with Optional JavaScript/TypeScript Support**

A lightweight scaffold for building C/C++ projects using a `Makefile`, with optional support for running JavaScript or TypeScript scripts via **bun**.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install required tools**

   - **C/C++ compiler**: Ensure `gcc` (or another compatible compiler) is installed.
   - **bun** (optional, for JavaScript/TypeScript): Install from https://bun.sh if you plan to run JS/TS scripts.

   ```bash
   # Example for Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   # Install bun (if needed)
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```

3. **(Optional) Install project dependencies**

   If the project includes Node.js packages, run:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

## Usage

### Build & Run (C/C++)

The project uses a `Makefile` for building. Ensure you have `gcc` (or a compatible compiler) installed.

```bash
# Build the project
make

# Run the executable (replace <executable> with the actual name)
./<executable>
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Support

If the repository contains JavaScript or TypeScript files, you can execute them with **bun**:

```bash
# Run a script using bun
bun run <script>
```
