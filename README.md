## Building the Project (C/C++)

To compile the C/C++ sources, run:

```sh
make
```

The `Makefile` handles compilation flags and dependencies.

## Build & Run (C/C++)

```bash
# Build the project
make

# Run the executable (replace <executable> with the actual name)
./<executable>
```

## Running JavaScript/TypeScript

If the project includes JavaScript or TypeScript files, you can use `bun`:

```sh
bun run <script>
```

## Testing

If tests are provided, they can be run with:

```bash
make test
```
