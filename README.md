# org

_Agentic dev helpers that can "do things" in your repo while you watch, review, and approve every change._

- ‚úèÔ∏è **Conversational**: give a task, the agent plans and executes.
- ü§ù **Collaborative**: works as part of a multi-agent setup, coordinating steps and maintaining a conversation between the agents.
- üß∞ **Tools**: `sh`, `apply_patch`, etc. 100% auditable.
- üîí **Safe-by-default**: denylist for dangerous paths; *every* change turns into a patch you review before it lands.
- üß™ **Deterministic runs**: all stdout/stderr, artifacts, and a git patch are saved under `.org/runs/<id>` for inspection or CI upload.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Optional containerized sandbox**: run steps inside a Podman container with no network by default.

> Security note. org is safe-by-default but not a hardened sandbox. For a stronger boundary, run it in the provided VM profile (Lima on Apple Silicon, VirtualBox on Intel). See SECURITY.md for hardening 

## Vision

Developers and operators deserve AI teammates they can **trust, understand, and control**. Most tools either go fully automated (opaque, risky) or stay passive (just suggest, never act). This project takes a different stance:

* **Dev + DevOps, one CLI**: A single agentic workflow that works for both coding and operations. Write code, run infra, and patch your repo ‚Äî all inside the same safe loop.
* **Multi-agent as a first-class feature**: Collaboration isn't a bolt-on. Agents can coordinate, debate, and hand off tasks, while you oversee and approve every change.
* **Sandbox + patch review**: Every command runs in isolation. Every file change is surfaced as a patch. Nothing merges until you say so.
* **Safety as a value, not a feature**: Guardrails, glob-based policies, and human-in-the-loop review make it impossible for an agent to "go rogue" in your repo.
* **Composable workflows**: Use it solo as a powerful dev helper, or spin up multiple agents to cover testing, ops, and review simultaneously.

The vision is simple: **an agent CLI that feels like a real teammate ‚Äî fast, opinionated, and safe.**

## Quick Start

### macOS (Apple Silicon: M1/M2/M3) ‚Äî Lima backend
```sh
brew tap tjamescouch/org
brew install org
brew install lima            # VM provider on Apple Silicon
orgctl vm init               # uses .org/config/org.lima.yaml
```

### Lima 1.2.x shows boot logs; when it settles, press Ctrl-C to detach
```sh
orgctl vm ssh
orgctl app install --from host   # or: --from git / --from tar

macOS (Intel) ‚Äî VirtualBox backend
brew tap tjamescouch/org
brew install org
brew install --cask virtualbox
orgctl vm init
```

### Running
```sh
org
@@alice write "Hello World" to a file `hello-world.txt`
```

> Tip for contributors who installed an older brew orgctl: prefer the repo copy during development with PATH="$PWD:$PATH" or run ./orgctl ‚Ä¶.

When the tool wants to touch the filesystem, it first produces a **patch**. You can read, approve, or reject it. After approval, the agent continues.

All artifacts for each run land in `.org/runs/<uuid>/` with comprehensive logs and the final patch.
